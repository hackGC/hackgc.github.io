          <p> hackGC is a weekend-long event where Grinnellians come together in teams to collaborate, innovate and build a piece of technology (Minimum Viable Product/Prototype) to help alleviate a social justice issue. Come brainstorm and implement solutions with us! No coding experience necessary!  </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <p>As students at a small liberal arts college with an even smaller CS department, we're as aware as anybody else that there often seems to exist a "coder:non-coder" binary. Another purpose of hackGC, therefore, is to bridge that divide by offering a series of inspiring talks and workshops revolving around the intersection between social justice and technology, an excellent line-up of technical mentors, and an exhilarating hacking experience.</p>

          <button class="accordion">What is a hackathon?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Hackathon is like an “invention marathon”. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in Computer Science.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Who can participate?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              We welcome any Grinnell student! You don't have to major in CS. You aren't required to have ever attended a hackathon before. You can come with a team, hack alone, or create a team. If you are hacking alone and want to find a team, we have many ways to help you find other participants to pair with!
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What if I'm new?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              According to our survey, about 70% of Grinnell students have never participate in a hackathon before. We encourage new programmers to come because hackathons provide an opportunity to gain experience. As a new programmer at hackGC, you will learn a lot in a short amount of time, be challenged, and build something awesome.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Do I need to have a team to sign up?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Nope! Before the event,  <a href="https://crowdforge.io/hackathons/hackGC"> you can create teams/join other teams here</a>.

              We will also have a session after check in time to help people find team members, as well as a panel of guest speakers to help people think of ideas to work on for the hackathon. So you should sign up regardless!
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">How many people on a team?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              There can be up to four people per team.

          <button class="accordion">What can we build for hackGC?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Website, mobile app, a game (text-based is fine!), statistical model,  machine learning model, data visualization, a Shiny app, design sketch, or even just a well thought out idea! If you are wondering whether a piece of technology is eligible for hackGC, the answer is yes!
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Is this an MLH sponsored event?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Unfortunately, no. Since this is the first year of hackGC, we cap the number of participants at 50. We contacted MLH and they said they are not interested in sponsoring events that have less than 100 participants. We have worked our hardest with the resources we have to bring you a comparable and unique experience.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What should I bring?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Laptop chargers, phone chargers etc. Oh, and don't forget to bring friends, enthusiasm and willingness to challenge yourself!
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Do I have to be there the entire time?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              No, but all your coding and work must be done at the site of the competition.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Should I pull all-nighters?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Definitely not! The main purpose of the event is to learn alot, collaborate with other Grinnellians and have fun. You will not get the most out of the experience if you are not fully awake and are exhausted throughout the event. Self-care is important!
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">Can I start working before hackGC starts?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              No, participants are not allowed to work on their projects before the event. We WILL check this and will disqualify any teams/individuals who violate this. If you want to prepare for the hackathon, focus on gaining experience with and knowledge of the tools you hope to use to build your project.

            <p>
              Teams will demo their application, science fair style, to a panel of judges, who will deliberate on their favorite submissions to choose the winners.

                  <p>The path to social justice for healthcare in the United States is made difficult because of the powerful interests and patterns surrounding it: insurance companies, awkward delivery of care, and bad technology. In this talk, John Norman will talk about how his colleagues have attempted to "bring humanity to healthcare" by focussing on and rebooting primary care. In his work, business and ethical choices affect all parts of the business including core engineering.</p>

                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Biography</h4>
                  <p>John G. Norman graduated from Grinnell College in 1982, where he majored in English. After graduating he came back to the college and worked for two years as a programmer/analyst. Norman then went to Harvard where he earned a PhD in English, focusing on the relationship between Renaissance literature and medicine. Starting in 1993, Norman taught at the Ohio State University. In his final year at Ohio State he returned to technology as the Director of the pioneering. Computers in Composition and Literature program. </p>
                  <p> Moving back to Cambridge, Mass. in 1999, Norman wrote articles and reviews about teaching with technology and taught online a course in “Digital Culture” at the New School in New York City. He started work as a software developer at Cambridge Incubator (now Cambridge Innovation Center) and its affiliate companies. In 2003 he co-founded the VC-backed h3.com, which provided for tracking and rewarding job referrals via email and the web. Over this period, he taught Java and Ruby on Rails at Harvard Extension, and contributed a chapter to the book Java Enterprise in a Nutshell (2005). </p>
                  <p> In 2010, with former colleagues from Cambridge Innovation Center, he was the technical co-founder of Roomzilla, a system for managing conference rooms that utilizes tablet computers as ambient indicators of reservation status. At present, Norman is the VP of Technology and Security Officer, whose broad mission is to change primary care as we know it (on the tech team, they say that they are changing primary care, one line of code at a time...). He also occasionally teaches engineering at the University of Minnesota. </p>

                  <div align="left">
                    <p>
                    Erin Owen, MBA '94 is a woman and has been a business owner since 2004. In the past year, she has been researching funding options for women-owned businesses and investment options for everyday (not wealthy) women. What she learned both shocked her and motivated her to create a solution that bridges the gaps for women in the capital and investment marketplace.

                    In her presentation, she will share the statistics about how few women receive venture capital, hold positions of influence in the business and finance worlds, and the negative impact that has on women in the economy and in our society.

                    She will invite you to consider a number of questions including:
                    What would the world look like if...

                    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                      <li> ... there were as many women-owned large corporations and private businesses as men own now?</li>
                      <li>... there were as many women receiving capital (loans and investments) to grow their businesses as men do now?</li>
                      <li>... everyday women could band together and combine hundreds or thousands of small investments in women-owned businesses?</li>
                      <li> ...women’s business dreams were just as likely to succeed as men’s business dreams?</li>
                      <li>...there were more products and services available that met the needs of women and positively benefited women?</li>
                      <li> ...impact investing were re-defined to include a segment called "women impact"?</li>
                    </ul>
                    Ultimately, for the hackathon, she will invite you to consider: how can technology be used to connect small-scale women investors with women-owned start-ups & growth businesses for the benefit of women and our whole society?

                  </div>

                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Biography</h4>
                  <p>Erin Owen ’94 is disrupting herself. Currently, Erin is winding down her business of 14 years while she focuses on the start-up phase of her next business. What’s next for Erin? Channeling all her knowledge, experience, passions, values, and network-leveraging skills into a new business. Right now in the start-up or “ideation” phase, the venture is focused on expanding the capital market for women and falls into the “gender lens” investing sector. Tagline: “by women, for women”. Focus: giving every woman a chance to invest at the $10 and up level, driving more money to businesses with a product or service that benefits women.</p>
                  <p> Erin envisions an online platform where women can invest in other women (think Kiva or Grameen America) with the transparency of social media,  bolstered by small group connection and support – the way that women have come together for generations. Why fight for a seat at the existing table, when we can build a whole new foundation upon which the tables of future generations are set?! Currently Erin is drafting the business plan, meeting with potential co-founders, searching for a fiscal sponsorship partner, and boot-strapping it along the way with a phenomenally positive support group. </p>

                  <p>"In recent years, we have seen massive mobilizations that have all relied on social media to scale up - from Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter to #MeToo and #NotOneMore. Beyond the US borders, there have been massive protests across the world from the Arab Spring to Turkey, Ukraine, Hong Kong and South Korea. Additionally, the ubiquity of recording devices has made it possible to document human rights violations as they happen, and amplify the voices of activists.</p>
                  <p>However, technology has also facilitated gross human rights abuses, allowing governments to not just filter and block online content but also spy on their citizens. Activists have been arrested, detained, and tortured, based on their digital footprint. In the U.S., government entities have used similar technologies for religious and racial profiling and “predictive policing,” justifying them in the name of fighting terrorism and gang violence.</p>
                  <p>Does technology support or suppress movements? Is it possible to code ethics?"</p>

                  <h4 class="text-uppercase">Talk Title: "VR for the Liberal Arts and Social Good"</h4>
                  <p>This talk will examine the technological and psychological affordances that make virtual reality (VR) particularly well-suited for investigating liberal arts topics and promoting social justice issues. True VR allows a user to move and rotate in all three directions and interact with objects as a person would in the real world, which in turn can foster a sense of being physically present as an autonomous individual in recreated, remote, or even hypothetical sites. Not only can this sense of presence be useful for contextualizing knowledge within the spaces of these sites, but it can potentially also be used to transfer knowledge between the virtual environment and the real world. </p>
                  <p>Provided that hardware costs continue to fall and more VR experiences are released as open educational resources, VR also has the potential to democratize learning by giving a wider range of users access to sites that would be too difficult, dangerous, or expensive to see in person. Finally, by allowing users to to assume the first-person viewpoint of another human being and to experience reality from the perspective of this individual, VR has demonstrated the ability to promote empathy, self-other merging, and perspective taking. </p>
